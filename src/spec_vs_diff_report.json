      "requirement": "Add the missing Honeydew book PDF files to the frontend static assets so every backend Book.assetPath currently returned by getBooks() resolves to a real, publicly accessible file path (no 404 for listed /assets/*.pdf URLs; PDFs load from Landing->Reader via iframe or Open PDF button).",
